# CircleDrop

This Android game has a simple objective, to match falling coloured circles to the bucket of the corresponding color at the bottom of the screen. 

Features:
- Starting with 5 circles, after each round the number of circles will increase by 5 along with an increased dropping velocity.
- Cirlces are moved by dragging them acros the screen. Touching the screen anywhere within the circle's area will cause it to center on the pressed finger.
- The game ends when 5 circles pass through incorrect buckets in a single round. The player's 5 chances are replenished each round if they do not get a game over.
- The user's high score is persisted.

Scoring:
- +10 points for every correctly matched circle.
- -20 points for every circle that passes through a bucket that does not match its colour.
